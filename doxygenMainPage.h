/** \mainpage
 * 
 * Tidbits is a C++ code snippet/utility library composed by Naja Melan. It consists of a number of git repositories which can be included by opensource projects individually
 * or as a collection by using the tidbits repository. Many of the code snippets are copied from or inspired by other authors. Reference to source shall given 
 * whenever possible. No copyright claims are made for this code. All rights remain with the original authors, unless for code written by Naja Melan
 * which is in the public domain.
 * 
 * At the moment the library is very young and no claims for quality can yet be made. I have thusfar not released any opensource projects that make use of this
 * library and the library must thus be considered as under construction. If you have good code snippets like this and want to join this project, I am happy
 * to collaborate. It will be all the better if different people take on the maintainance of different snippets. The modular design of the library makes this
 * very easy. Especially if you see your own code in TidBits and would like to maintain it, drop me a line and I make you the maintainer of the repository.
